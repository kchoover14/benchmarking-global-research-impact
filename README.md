This project analyzes the global COVID-19 research landscape to support strategic funding and partnership decisions. Using publication metadata from the Dimensions COVID-19 dataset via Google BigQuery, I developed a novel **Impact-Weighted Research Output metric** that balances field-normalized citation impact with publication volume, then applied it to benchmark country-level performance, map international collaboration networks, and compare research contributions across disciplines. **The US, UK, China, Australia, and the Netherlands consistently ranked highest, with the US surpassing global benchmarks across most fields; Math and Physical Sciences and Philosophy and Religious Studies showed the highest field-level impact despite lower publication volume than Biomedical and Clinical Sciences.**
