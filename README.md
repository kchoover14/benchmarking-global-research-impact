## Benchmarking Research Impact Across Countries and Fields at Scale

Standard bibliometric measures -- raw citation counts and average Field Citation Ratios -- are poorly suited for cross-country and cross-field comparison. Citation counts ignore field norms; average FCR collapses across vastly different publication volumes. Without field-sensitive measures, research landscape assessments produce a distorted picture: funders miss high-impact targets, institutions fail to recognize their own relative strengths, and potential partners go unidentified because volume-based rankings bury the contributors that matter most. This project develops and validates an Impact-Weighted Research Output metric that balances field-normalized citation impact with log-transformed publication volume, then applies it to benchmark country-level performance, map international collaboration networks, and compare research contributions across disciplines using the Dimensions COVID-19 public dataset via Google BigQuery.
